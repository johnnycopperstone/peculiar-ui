peculiar-ui [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johnnycopperstone/peculiar-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnnycopperstone/peculiar-ui)
===========

User Interface Documentation Library built using AngularJS.

###FYI

I'm still in the process of releasing this, and have pushed it up to github so I can work from different machines. Should only be a few days.

###Why 'peculiar'?

Naming is the worst. So to solve this problem, at the time of deciding what to name to the project, I take the name of the song currently playing (my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/johnny-copperstone/likes) is usually always on while I'm working). At the time, this was on:

[Ain't That Peculiar - Oddisee Remix](https://soundcloud.com/oddiseemusic/oddisee-aint-that-peculiar-remix)

###Why This Library?

I'll be writing a blog post about this in the coming days.
