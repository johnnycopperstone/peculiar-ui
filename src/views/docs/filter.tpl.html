<pu-section title="Filter">

    >> This filter component is used to toggle between developer view or product view. This is useful when you want to strip out all the development related documentation, and just see a structured view of the user interface.
    >> You can add this anywhere on your page, and all the other components will automatically react to the toggle.
    >> You can only use one of these with your app however (not that I can think of a use case of needing more than one). Well, technically you can use as many as you want, but they will all inherit from the same angular service, which is a singleton, therefore the same value - as you can see on this page, both filters change.
