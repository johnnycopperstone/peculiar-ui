    >>This tool uses AngularJs' directive functionality to extend HTML and create custom elements with defined functionality.
    >>In this way, I can hide away all the logical complexity and DOM API, classes and the < div /> soup behind 1 custom element tag, making the markup as readable and maintainable as possible.
    >>This also allows for added functionality like adding markdown parsing for specific elements (directives). Using this, making a table could become a trivial thing of using just 1 (custom)html tag and your table data. #readable #maintainable
